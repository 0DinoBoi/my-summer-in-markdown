<h3>Favorite Summer Food</h3>
During the summer, I got to enjoyed tons of very delicious food. One thing I wanted to mention is a place up in Porter Ranch called Lure House. This was my first time eating at a Lure House and I got a classic Clam Chowder. Their clam chowder was very good because something about their clams in the soup was so good, but that wasn't even the best part. The best part was the dessert because what can go wrong with some dessert at a pretty fancy restaurant. I got one of their hot chocolate fudge cakes. This cake was so good and like it felt like every bite was melting in my mouth. That had to be one of my top 5 desserts ever.

<h3>Sport</h3>
Every day in the summer I would always be doing something active. It was either working out or playing my favorite sport, baseball. This summer I was trying to improve on my baseball skills to make varsity this year for Chatsworth. Another physical activity that I did was swimming in my pool with my dog. My dog loves to swim, and it is funny when he just keeps getting out of the pool to jump in again.

<h3>Goals for the School Year</h3>
My goals for this school year to to at least have 4 A's in my classes. Also, I need to get in some hours for community service and volunteer hours because my freshman year I did not participate in any activities. For my sport, I want to have better stats in everything and make varsity this year. My final goal is to make my sophmore year a great year.
